Project will be a client for my other myFlix server project.

The myFlix server project is the API that this client works with.

Currently working with the MERN stack and learning to use Parcel and React.

Current project uses ES2023 version of Javascript.

Project can be run with these instructions:

Open command console and navigate to the directory of the project,

Command "parcel src/index.html".
